# Case Study Brief - Backend Engineer with AI Focus
**Date:** November 2024
**Duration:** 5 days
**Role:** Backend Engineer (AI/ML Integration)

## Hello Candidate!

Thank you for applying with us as a Backend Engineer. This mini project should be completed within 5 days after you have received this document. Please spare your time to complete this project with the best results. We are really pleased to answer your questions if there are unclear things.

## Objective

Your mission is to build a backend service that automates the initial screening of job applications. The service will receive a candidate's CV and a project report, evaluate them against a specific job description and a case study brief, and produce a structured, AI-generated evaluation report.

**We are specifically looking for candidates who demonstrate strong backend engineering capabilities combined with modern AI/ML integration skills.**

## Core Logic & Data Flow

The system operates with a clear separation of inputs and reference documents:

### Candidate-Provided Inputs (The Data to be Evaluated)
- **Candidate CV:** The candidate's resume (PDF)
- **Project Report:** The candidate's project report to our take-home case study (PDF)

### System-Internal Documents (The "Ground Truth" for Comparison)
- **Job Description:** Requirements for Backend Engineer with AI focus
- **Case Study Brief:** This document. Used as ground truth for Project Report
- **Scoring Rubric:** Predefined parameters for evaluating CV and Report

**We want to see your ability to combine backend engineering with AI workflows (prompt design, LLM chaining, retrieval, resilience).**

## Deliverables

### 1. Backend Service (API endpoints)
Implement a backend service with the following RESTful API endpoints:

#### POST /upload
Accepts multipart/form-data containing the Candidate CV and Project Report (PDF).
- Stores these files with secure filenames and timestamps
- Returns each with its own ID for later processing
- Processes files asynchronously for text extraction and RAG ingestion

#### POST /evaluate
Triggers the asynchronous AI evaluation pipeline.
- Receives input job title (string), cv_id, and report_id
- Immediately returns a job ID to track the evaluation process
```json
{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

#### GET /result/{id}
Retrieves the status and result of an evaluation job.
Should reflect the asynchronous, multi-stage nature of the process.

**Possible responses:**
While queued or processing:
```json
{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "queued" | "processing"
}
```

Once completed:
```json
{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "cv_match_rate": 0.85,
    "cv_feedback": "Strong backend fundamentals with demonstrated AI/ML experience...",
    "project_score": 4.7,
    "project_feedback": "Excellent RAG implementation with proper error handling...",
    "overall_summary": "Highly recommended candidate with strong AI/backend hybrid expertise..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Evaluation Pipeline
Design and implement an AI-driven pipeline triggered by POST /evaluate endpoint:

#### RAG (Context Retrieval)
- Ingest all System-Internal Documents into a vector database
- Retrieve relevant sections and inject into prompts
- Use context retrieval for CV scoring vs project scoring

#### Prompt Design & LLM Chaining
**CV Evaluation Pipeline:**
1. Parse candidate's CV into structured data
2. Retrieve relevant information from Job Description and AI/ML requirements
3. Use LLM to extract: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback with AI/ML focus

**Project Report Evaluation Pipeline:**
1. Parse candidate's Project Report into structured data
2. Retrieve relevant information from Case Study Brief and AI implementation requirements
3. Use LLM to evaluate: project_score & project_feedback with AI/backend hybrid focus

**Final Analysis:**
1. Use final LLM call to synthesize outputs into overall_summary
2. Focus on backend quality + AI/ML integration capabilities

#### Long-Running Process Handling
- POST /evaluate should not block until processing completes
- Store task, return job ID, allow periodic status checks
- Implement proper job queue and worker management

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- Handle LLM API failures (timeouts, rate limits)
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Control LLM temperature for response consistency
- Design fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable
