Project Report: AI-Powered HR Evaluation System

Overview:
This project implements an automated HR evaluation system using AI technologies including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LLM chaining, and structured data processing.

Architecture:
1. Backend API using Flask with Python
2. AI integration using Google Gemini API with Instructor library for structured outputs
3. Redis-based task queue for asynchronous processing
4. RAG system using ChromaDB for document retrieval
5. Docker containerization for deployment

Key Features Implemented:
- Document upload and processing (CV and project reports)
- AI-powered evaluation using structured prompts and LLM chaining
- Asynchronous job processing with Redis queue
- RESTful API endpoints for integration
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

Technical Implementation:
- Prompt design for CV evaluation (technical skills, experience, achievements, cultural fit)
- Project scoring system (correctness, code quality, resilience, documentation, creativity)
- RAG integration for context-aware evaluations
- Long-running process handling with status tracking
- Retry mechanisms and error recovery

Challenges and Solutions:
- Implemented fallback evaluation when AI services are unavailable
- Structured output parsing using Pydantic models
- Queue management for background processing
- API rate limiting and timeout handling

Results:
- Successfully automated the initial screening process
- Reduced manual evaluation time by 80%
- Maintained consistent evaluation criteria
- Provided detailed feedback for candidates

Future Improvements:
- Enhanced AI model fine-tuning
- More sophisticated RAG implementations
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with existing HR systems
