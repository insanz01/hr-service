C a s e  S t u d y  B r i e f
Hello! Thank you for applying with us as a backend developer. This mini project should be completed within 5 days after you 
have received this document. Please spare your time to complete this project with the best results. We are really pleased to 
answer your questions if there are unclear things. 
Objective
Your mission is to build a backend service that automates the initial screening of a job application. The service will receive a 
candidate's CV and a project report, evaluate them against a specific job description and a case study brief, and produce a 
structured, AI-generated evaluation report.
Core Logic & Data Flow
The system operates with a clear separation of inputs and reference documents:
Candidate-Provided Inputs (The Data to be Evaluated):
Candidate CV: The candidate's resume (PDF).
Project Report: The candidate's project report to our take-home case study (PDF)
System-Internal Documents (The "Ground Truth" for Comparison):
Job Description: A document detailing the requirements and responsibilities for the role — You can use the job description 
you’re currently applying. This document will be used as ground truth for Candidate CV.
To make sure the vector retrieval is accurate enough, you might need to ingest a few job description documents as well.
Case Study Brief: This document. Used as ground truth for Project Report. (PDF)
Scoring Rubric: A predefined set of parameters for evaluating CV and Report, each has it’s own documents. (PDF)
We want to see your ability to combine backend engineering with AI workflows (prompt design, LLM chaining, retrieval, 
resilience).
Deliverables
1. Backend Service (API endpoints)
Implement a backend service with at least the following RESTful API endpoints:
POST /upload
Accepts multipart/form-data containing the Candidate CV and Project Report (PDF).
Stores these files, return each with it’s own ID for later processing.
POST /evaluate
Triggers the asynchronous AI evaluation pipeline. Receives input job title (string), and both document ID.
Immediately returns a job ID to track the evaluation process.
{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "queued"
}
GET /result/{id}
Retrieves the status and result of an evaluation job. This endpoint should reflect the asynchronous, multi-stage nature 
of the process.
Possible responses:
While queued or processing
{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "queued" | "processing"
}

{
  "id": "456",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "cv_match_rate": 0.82,
    "cv_feedback": "Strong in backend and cloud, limited AI integration experience...",
    "project_score": 4.5,
    "project_feedback": "Meets prompt chaining requirements, lacks error handling robustness...",
    "overall_summary": "Good candidate fit, would benefit from deeper RAG knowledge..."
  }
}
2. Evaluation Pipeline
Design and implement an AI-driven pipeline which will be triggered by [POST] /evaluate endpoint. Should consist these key 
Components:
RAG (Context Retrieval)
Ingest all System-Internal Documents (Job Description, Case Study Brief, Both Scoring Rubrics) into a vector 
database.
Retrieve relevant sections and inject into prompts (e.g., “for CV scoring” vs “for project scoring”).
Prompt Design & LLM Chaining
The pipeline should consists of
CV Evaluation
Parse the candidate’s CV into structured data.
Retrieve relevant information from both Job Description and CV Scoring Rubrics.
Use an LLM to get these result: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback
Project Report Evaluation
Parse the candidate's Project Report into structured data.
Retrieve relevant information from both Case Study Brief and CV Scoring Rubrics.
Use an LLM to get these result: project_score & project_feedback 
Final Analysis
Use a final LLM call to synthesize the outputs from previous steps into a concise overall_summary.
Long-Running Process Handling
POST /evaluate should not block until LLM Chaining finishes.
Store task, return job ID, allow GET /result/{id} to check later periodically.
Error Handling & Randomness Control
Simulate any edge cases you can think of and how well your service can handle them.
Simulate failures from LLM API (timeouts, rate limit).
Implement retries/back-off.
Control LLM temperature or add validation layer to keep responses stable.
3. Standardized Evaluation Parameters
Define at least these scoring parameters:
CV Evaluation (Match Rate)
Technical Skills Match (backend, databases, APIs, cloud, AI/LLM exposure).
Experience Level (years, project complexity).
Relevant Achievements (impact, scale).
Cultural Fit (communication, learning attitude).
Project Deliverable Evaluation
Correctness (meets requirements: prompt design, chaining, RAG, handling errors).
Code Quality (clean, modular, testable).
Resilience (handles failures, retries). •

Use a simple vector DB (e.g. ChromaDB, Qdrant, etc) or RAG-as-a-service (e.g. Ragie, S3 Vector, etc), any of your own 
choice.
Provide README with run instructions + explanation of design choices.
Provide the documents together with their ingestion scripts in the repository for reproducability purposes. •

Rakamin is hiring a Product Engineer (Backend) to work on Rakamin. We're looking for dedicated engineers who write code 
they’re proud of and who are eager to keep scaling and improving complex systems, including those powered by AI.
A b o u t  t h e  J o b
You'll be building new product features alongside a frontend engineer and product manager using our Agile methodology, as 
well as addressing issues to ensure our apps are robust and our codebase is clean. As a Product Engineer, you'll write clean, 
efficient code to enhance our product's codebase in meaningful ways.
In addition to classic backend work, this role also touches on building AI-powered systems, where you’ll design and orchestrate 
how large language models (LLMs) integrate into Rakamin’s product ecosystem.
Here are some real examples of the work in our team:
Collaborating with frontend engineers and 3rd parties to build robust backend solutions that support highly configurable 
platforms and cross-platform integration.
Developing and maintaining server-side logic for central database, ensuring high performance throughput and response 
time.
Designing and fine-tuning AI prompts that align with product requirements and user contexts.
Building LLM chaining flows, where the output from one model is reliably passed to and enriched by another.
Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by embedding and retrieving context from vector databases, then 
injecting it into AI prompts to improve accuracy and relevance.
Handling long-running AI processes gracefully — including job orchestration, async background workers, and retry 
mechanisms.
Designing safeguards for uncontrolled scenarios: managing failure cases from 3rd party APIs and mitigating the 
randomness/nondeterminism of LLM outputs.
Leveraging AI tools and workflows to increase team productivity (e.g., AI-assisted code generation, automated QA, internal 
bots).
Writing reusable, testable, and efficient code to improve the functionality of our existing systems.
Strengthening our test coverage with RSpec to build robust and reliable web apps.
Conducting full product lifecycles, from idea generation to design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Providing input on technical feasibility, timelines, and potential product trade-offs, working with business divisions.
Actively engaging with users and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into backend and AI-driven 
improvements.
A b o u t  Y o u
We’re looking for candidates with a strong track record of working on backend technologies of web apps, ideally with exposure 
to AI/LLM development or a strong desire to learn.
You should have experience with backend languages and frameworks (Node.js, Django, Rails), as well as modern backend 
tooling and technologies such as:
Database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
RESTful APIs
Security compliance
Cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
Server-side languages (Java, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript)
Understanding of frontend technologies
User authentication and authorization between multiple systems, servers, and environments
Scalable application design principles
Creating database schemas that represent and support business processes
Implementing automated testing platforms and unit tests
Familiarity with LLM APIs, embeddings, vector databases and prompt design best practices
We're not big on credentials, so a Computer Science degree or graduating from a prestigious university isn't something we 
emphasize. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not how you got here. •
